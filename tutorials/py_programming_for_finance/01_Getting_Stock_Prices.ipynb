    "Hello and welcome to a Python for Finance tutorial series. In this series, we're going to run through the basics of importing financial (stock) data into Python using the Pandas framework. From here, we'll manipulate the data and attempt to come up with some sort of system for investing in companies, apply some machine learning, even some deep learning, and then learn how to back-test a strategy. I assume you know the [fundamentals](https://pythonprogramming.net/python-fundamental-tutorials/) of Python. If you're not sure if that's you, click the fundamentals link, look at some of the topics in the series, and make a judgement call. If at any point you are stuck in this series or confused on a topic or concept, feel free to ask for help and I will do my best to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question that I am asked is whether or not I make a profit investing or trading with these techniques. I mostly play with finance data for fun and to practice my data analysis skills, but it actually does also influence my investment decisions to this day. I do not do active algorithmic trading with programming at the time of my writing this, but I have, and I have actually made a profit, but it's a lot more work than you might think to algorithmically trade. Finally, the knowledge about how to manipulate and analyze financial data, as well as how to backtest trading stategies, has **saved** me a ton of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the strategies presented here will make you an ultra wealthy person. If they would, I'd probably keep them to myself! The knowledge itself, however, can save you money, and even make you money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright great, let's get started. To begin, I am using Python 3.5, but you should be able to get by with later versions. I will assume you already have Python installed. If you do not have 64 bit Python, but do have a 64bit operating system, get 64 bit Python, it'll help you a bit later. If you're on a 32 bit operating system, I am sorry for your situation, but you should be fine to follow most of this anyway.\n",

    "Required Modules to start:\n",
    "1. **Numpy**\n",
    "2. **Matplotlib**\n",
    "3. **Pandas**\n",
    "4. **Pandas-datareader**\n",
    "5. **BeautifulSoup4**\n",
    "6. **scikit-learn / sklearn**\n",
    "\n",
    "That'll do for now, we'll deal with other modules as they come up. To begin, let's cover how we might go about dealing with stock data using pandas, matplotlib and Python.\n",

    "* Adj Close - This one is slightly more complicated, but, over time, companies may decide to do something called a stock split. For example, Apple did one once their stock price exceeded \\\\$1000. Since in most cases, people cannot buy fractions of shares, a stock price of \\\\$1,000 is fairly limiting to investors. Companies can do a stock split where they say every share is now 2 shares, and the price is half. Anyone who had 1 share of Apple for \\\\$1,000, after a split where Apple doubled the shares, they would have 2 shares of Apple (AAPL), each worth \\\\$500. Adj Close is helpful, since it accounts for future stock splits, and gives the relative price to splits. For this reason, the adjusted prices are the prices you're most likely to be dealing with."
