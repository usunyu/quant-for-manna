    "Hello and welcome to part 9 of the Python for Finance tutorial series. In the previous tutorials, we've covered how to pull in stock pricing data for a large number of companies, how to combine that data into one large dataset, and how to visually represent at least one relationship between all of the companies. Now, we're going to try to take this data and do some machine learning with it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to see what might happen if we took data from all of the current companies, and fed this through some sort of machine learning classifier. We know that, over time, various companies have different relationships with eachother, so, if the machine can recognize and fit these relationships, it's possible we could predict from changes in prices today, what will happen tomorrow with a specific company. Let's try!\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, all machine learning does is take \"featuresets\" and attempts to map them to \"labels.\" Whether we're doing [K Nearest Neighbors](https://pythonprogramming.net/k-nearest-neighbors-intro-machine-learning-tutorial/) or [deep learning with neural networks](https://pythonprogramming.net/neural-networks-machine-learning-tutorial/), this remains the same. Thus, we need to convert our existing data to featuresets and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our features can be other company's prices, but we're going to instead say the features are the pricing changes that day for all companies. Our label will be whether or not we actually want to buy a specific company. Let's say we're considering Exxon (XOM). What we'll do for featuresets is take into account all company percent changes that day, and those will be our features. Our label will be whether or not Exxon (XOM) rose more than x% within the next x days, where we can pick whatever we want for x. To start, let's say a company is a buy if, within the next 7 days, its price goes up more than 2% and it is a sell if the price goes down more than 2% within those 7 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something we could also relatively easily make a strategy for. If the algorithm says buy, we can buy, place a 2% drop stop-loss (basically something that tells the exchange is price falls below this number / or goes above if you're shorting the company, then exit my position). Otherwise, sell the company once it has risen 2%, or you could be conservative and sell at 1% rise...etc. Regardless, you could relatively easily build a strategy from this classifier. In order to begin, we need the prices into the future for our training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to keep coding in our same script. If this is a problem to you, feel free to create a new file and import the functions we use.\n",
    "\n",
